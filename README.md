Text Based RPG Game

To do:
  Design game "engine"
    Explore mode
      Player movement arround an array type map
    Combat mode
      Combat will occur occastionally, likely a chance based encounter based on the 
      tile that they are on
      Will loop each char in the fight's turns until health <= 0
    All modes
      Certain functions will need to be available no matter what mode we are in, they
      will be called with a text "letter", to be determined ("i" for inventory)
  Design how combat will function
    Math and interaction between attack/defense
    May add additional stats(speed, magic) for additional class distinction (stretch        goal)
